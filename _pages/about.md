## welcome

Dr. Ying Xiong works on a variety of topics related to atmospheric chemistry, air pollution, climate change, global health, and environmental justice. Broadly, his research focuses on understanding the spatiotemporal variability in the emissions of air pollutants (e.g., aerosols, ozone, VOCs) and greenhouse gases at locale, regional, and global scales. An underlying theme of his work is assessing the dynamic impacts of anthropogenic and natural activities on the carbon cycle in response to the warming environment and ultimatey elucidating the feedbacks between the carbon cycle, climate change, and human health.

Dr. Ying Xiong is a Research Fellow in the Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. He is seeking a tenue-track faculty position at the level of _Assistant Professor_ in atmospheric science, environmental science, geology, etc.
