## Welcome

Dr. Ying Xiong works on a variety of topics related to atmospheric chemistry, air pollution, climate change, global health, and environmental justice. Broadly, his research focuses on understanding the spatiotemporal variability in the emissions of air pollutants (e.g., aerosols, ozone, VOCs) and greenhouse gases at locale, regional, and global scales. An underlying theme of his work is assessing the impacts of anthropogenic and natural activities on the carbon cycle in response to the warming environment and conversely, elucidating the feedbacks between carbon cycle, climate change, and human health.
