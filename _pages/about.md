Dr. Ying Xiong works on a variety of topics related to atmospheric chemistry, air pollution, climate change, chemical transport model, global health, and environmental justice. Broadly, his research focuses on understanding the spatiotemporal variability in the emission magnitude of aerosol and greenhouse gases at locale, regional, and global scales. An underlying theme of his work is assessing the impacts of variations in anthropogenic and natural sources on the carbon cycle and, ultimately, elucidating the interactions between atmospheric chemistry, climate change, and human health.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
